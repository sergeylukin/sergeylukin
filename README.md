  - According to [Causal knowledge and imitation test](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10071-004-0239-6) performed with chimpanzees and 3-5yo human children, and that is in my opinion mindblowing, chimps quickly find an optimized solution to get their reward and call it a day while humans irrationally copy what they've been shown by a teacher even when there are useless steps not related to the reward. At first, it may raise a thought former are smarter, while deeper thought brings me to believe "system" and abilitiy to cooperate rather than just follow our personal interests is more important and is what results in human having built cities and infrastructure throughout centuries while chimps still follow their direct instincts in optimized ways. Funny and mindblowing at the same time in my opinion. ([a great article on this topic](https://phys.org/news/2020-01-copycats-key-human.html))
  - it's cold outside and your body temperature starts to drop, the hypothalamus sends a message to your body that it needs to warm up. One way it does that is through your muscles, which generate heat by shivering. Teeth chattering is just a form of shivering.
